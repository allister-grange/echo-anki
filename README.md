# echo-anki

Write a project that will:

- take a list of known words to build my vocabulary off of, this will be a local file that the script will update with words as I run them through the scripts (the first 500 or so will have to be manually uploaded as a starting point)
- when I run the script with a word as a parameter it will:
  - create a sentence with known words
  - create a voice recording of that sentence
  - create an anki card with the recording on the front, the sentence on the back with the key word bolded
